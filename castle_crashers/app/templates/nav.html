navigation

<!-- the first one could just be written as:

  <a href="/">HOME</a>

'url_for' is used along with the name of the '/'
function because if we ever change the name of the
home route it won't matter - it references it by the
function regardless of the route name.

--snippet from routes.py--

@app.route('/')      # this is the '/' route
def home():          # this is the '/' function

This is not mandatory, its just best practice. -->
